Project Description: Development of a Comprehensive Data Ecosystem

This project aims to design and implement a robust data ecosystem comprising a relational database, data warehouse, and associated OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) operations. The project extends its scope to include data mining techniques such as clustering and decision tree analysis, as well as text mining for extracting valuable insights from unstructured textual data.

Components:

Relational Database:

Design and development of a relational database to efficiently store structured data.
Implementation of a normalized schema to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.
Integration of SQL queries for data retrieval, manipulation, and maintenance.
Data Warehouse:

Construction of a data warehouse for the consolidation of diverse data sources.
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to transfer and transform data into the warehouse.
Implementation of snowflake schema for optimized data querying and reporting.
OLAP Operations:

Integration of OLAP operations for multidimensional analysis of data.
Implementation of drill-down, roll-up, slice, and dice operations to explore data from various perspectives.


Data Mining (Clustering and Decision Tree) using Weka Software:

Application of clustering algorithms to identify patterns and group similar data points.
Development of a decision tree model for predictive analysis and classification.
Integration of data mining results into the database for actionable insights.

Text Mining:
Handmade Text-mining exercises

Benefits:

Enhanced decision-making through multidimensional analysis.
Predictive insights from data mining techniques for improved planning.

Outcome:

A fully functional and integrated data ecosystem.
